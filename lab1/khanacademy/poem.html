        <h1>Morning Light</h1>
        <p>
The sun wakes up the quiet sky,<br>
Soft clouds are slowly passing by.<br>
A gentle breeze, a simple start,<br>
Warm hope is filling every heart.<br>
Birds sing songs so clear and small,<br>
Light and peace are over all.<br>
A brand-new day, calm and bright,<br>
Begins with soft and golden light.<br>
